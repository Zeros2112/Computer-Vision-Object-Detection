# 1. Mask R-CNN Image Segmentation Demo

This repository demonstrates how to use a Mask R-CNN model from TensorFlow Hub for object detection and instance segmentation. The notebook guides you through the process of loading the model, performing inference on test images, and visualizing the results.

## Overview

- **Installation**: Cloning the TensorFlow Models repository and setting up the Object Detection API for TensorFlow 2.
- **Model**: Using a Mask R-CNN model from TensorFlow Hub for instance segmentation.
- **Inference**: Running inference on selected test images and visualizing the results.

# 2. Image Segmentation using FCN-8

This Jupyter notebook contains the code for implementing image segmentation using the FCN-8 (Fully Convolutional Network) architecture. The code is organized into different sections, each serving a specific purpose in building and training the segmentation model.
